# setup-react-typescript-rquery-zustand


Initial setup of a project. 

It includes:
  - the backbone of the project and file structure (differentiated by 2 inpothetical user types)
  - some pages and components as an example
  - routing and navigation
  - api requests using react-query (not all endpoints are working, some of them are only as an example)
  - authentication layer 
  - multilanguage
  - global store using zustand
  
 This is just a guide, based on your needs you'll have to adapt and change some things.
